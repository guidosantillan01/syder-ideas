## Quick Guide

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:
1. Clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/guidosantillan01/readme-template
```
2. Go into the repository
```sh
cd readme-template
```
3. Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
4. Run the app, you will then be able to access it at `localhost:3000`
```sh
npm start
```

> Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.

## Getting Started
> *These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.*

### Prerequisites
> *What things you need to install the software and how to install them*

* abc
* abc

### Initial Configuration
> *Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, npm i). This is the section where you would document those requirements.*


### Installation

*This project* requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

> *Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.*

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

> *For production environments...*

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```



## Development setup
>*Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:*

Clone this repo to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.


```sh
git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.




## Running the tests
